            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>My journey at UEM has been a thrilling adventure filled with diverse experiences that have truly shaped my academic and professional growth.

                I’ve had the opportunity to dive into various events where I learned from talented developers and participated in financial events. One of my favorite roles was taking the lead in creating posters and flyers—who knew design could be so fun?  These experiences not only honed my leadership and organizational skills but also sparked my passion for collaboration.
                
                Driven by my interest in web and app development, I’ve started learning about these fields on my own. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding journey, and I can’t wait to dive even deeper!
                
                Whether I’m working solo or with a team, I’ve sharpened my time management, creative problem-solving, and communication skills. I’m excited about the future and look forward to leveraging these experiences in my next professional role.
